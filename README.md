# AutoRAY MANAGER

## What is AutoRAY MANAGER?
### After you set up your [AutoRAY server](https://github.com/iWebbIO/AUTORAY) you need a way to connect to your server and manage the settings without the need to always be connected to your server through SSH/SCP/FTP etc.
and using AutoRAY MANAGER you can control your keys (and soon more) without the need of a constant connection to your server
This makes it easier, faster and safer and saves you a ton of time!
